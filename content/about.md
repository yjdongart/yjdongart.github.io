As a Chinese-American artist, I craft abstract works that embody my personal experiences navigating between two distinct cultural backgrounds.

My artistic creations often blend traditional elements of Chinese art, such as brushwork and ink painting, with contemporary American art styles, such as the use of bold colors and abstract forms. Through this unique combination, I aim to communicate the tension that arises from my dual cultural identities. Being a cultural intermediary, I am acutely aware of the differences between China and the United States, and my art serves as a visual expression of this cultural tension.

My work draws inspiration from the organic forms, textures, and colors found in nature, as well as the emotions they evoke. My pieces are characterized by layered compositions and fragmented forms, symbolizing the overlapping and disjointed nature of my experiences. It is my intention that my art serves as a bridge between these two cultures, exploring universal themes such as identity, displacement, and cultural conflict.

I hope that my work will connect with other individuals who have undergone similar experiences as immigrants, inspiring them to embrace both their cultural heritage and their new home.

My artistic creations are a visual representation of the cultural hybridity that defines my experiences as a Chinese immigrant in the United States.
