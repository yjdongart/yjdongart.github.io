My name is Yan Jun Dong. I was born in China in 2000 and grew up learning Chinese ink painting and traditional calligraphy. When I was fourteen, my family and I immigrated to the United States, where I learned Western oil painting techniques. Different from conventional Chinese artists or academic oil painters, I want to achieve a balance between Eastern and Western cultures in my paintings. Through my artworks, I hope to establish a fusion of cultural exchange. My work generally focuses on the intersection of lines and intense color contrasts, and the 2D presentation of oriental painting combines the 3D three-dimensional sense of oil painting techniques. Integrating my own life experience into art fascinated me during creation.
