Medium: ink, acrylic, watercolor

Three years of the epidemic have plunged me into a huge confusion. The world is chaotic, the political situation is turbulent, and the economy is the doldrums. The experience of the past three years has taught me that many things in my world are accidental but inevitable, but most things are beyond my control. Just like all the color combinations in the color block in the painting, it seems that all the color combinations are accidental. Still, in fact, Mr. Rabbit, who is in it, knows that only by using an attitude of ignorance against meaningless life and external voices can he find order in chaos and peace in confusion.
