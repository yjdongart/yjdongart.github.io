19.7" x 25.6"

Medium: ink, acrylic, watercolor

Walking to the top floor of each of the city's tallest buildings, I see that the city's neon lights always flash the same. The lights of all homes are bright, and the loneliness and loneliness accompany me because I know that the lights here do not belong to me.
