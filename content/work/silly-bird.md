A silly bird is staring at you boredly, as if asking why you have to repeat the boring life of year after year and day after day. The freedom to do whatever you want is a luxury that you haven't tasted for a long time. You may think this bird is stupid, but it laughs at you for not having the freedom to choose your life.
